\title{Coerce column types for finalized CDC dataset}
\usage{
clean_cdc_finalized(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A tibble returned from the CDC API with the finalized structure.}
}
\value{
A tibble with coerced column types and reordered columns.
}
\description{
This function standardizes the column types of a CDC dataset with the
finalized structure (e.g., dataset ID 'p7se-k3ix'), ensuring proper
coercion to factors, integers, numerics, and date formats. It also
handles missing flags and reorders columns to prioritize \code{time_period}
and \code{time_period_id} for consistency.
