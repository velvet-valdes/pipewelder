\title{pipeweldr: Pipelines for Economic Time Series}
\description{
This package provides a consistent, modular set of tools for retrieving,
cleaning, and processing both public economic data and health data from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
}
\section{Pipelines}{

\itemize{
\item \code{get_bls()} retrieves BLS time series across large time ranges.
\item \code{get_fred()} retrieves and tidies FRED data from the St. Louis Fed.
\item \code{get_cdc()} retrieves and aggregates CDC data.
}

Internal helper functions handle chunking, formatting, and error management,
allowing end-users to call a single function for each pipeline.
