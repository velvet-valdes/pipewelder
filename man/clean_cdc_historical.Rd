\description{
This function standardizes column types for historical-format CDC datasets
(e.g., dataset ID '9j2v-jamp'). It converts character fields into appropriate
factor, integer, numeric, or date types. It also handles missing flags and
reorders the output to place \code{year} and \code{year_num} as the first columns.
