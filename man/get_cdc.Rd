\title{Retrieve and optionally clean CDC dataset records with schema harmonization}
\usage{
get_cdc(series_id)
}
\arguments{
\item{series_id}{A Socrata dataset ID string (e.g., "489q-934x")}
}
\value{
A tibble containing all records from the dataset. If recognized, the tibble
is cleaned and coerced to appropriate types; otherwise, it is returned unmodified.
}
\description{
Downloads all records from a CDC Socrata dataset using paginated API calls,
harmonizes the presence of the \code{flag} column across batches (if applicable),
and returns a single tibble. If the dataset structure is recognized, an
appropriate cleaning function is applied to coerce data types and re-order columns.
}
\details{
This function wraps the three-step process of:
\enumerate{
\item Collecting paginated data chunks
\item Ensuring consistent schema (with respect to the \code{flag} column)
\item Binding all records into a single tibble
}

If the dataset's column structure is not recognized, the raw tibble is returned
without coercion or reordering.
