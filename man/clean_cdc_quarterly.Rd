\description{
This function prepares quarterly-structured CDC datasets (e.g., dataset ID '489q-934x')
by converting relevant fields to factors, dates, and numerics. It parses \code{year_and_quarter}
into separate \code{year} (as Date) and \code{quarter} (as factor) columns, and reorders them to appear first.
